# Neuron-Number-Prediction

In this project I try to build a regression model to predict neuron counts in main brain regions of different species.
As you can see, results aren't great, sometimes I manage to get high r2_scores, but it strongly depends on train test split.
Hyperparameter tuning doesn't help much, probably more feature engineering is nedded.
